#
# CADT init file for systemd. To start the CADT service
# using systemd, execute `systemctl start cadt@<USERNAME>`
# where <USERNAME> is the Linux user you wish to run
# CADT as. Normally you'll run CADT on the same system
# as the Chia Wallet and Data Layer and you need to run
# CADT as the same user as Chia.
#
# For example, if running Chia as the ubuntu user
# with your $CHIA_ROOT directory at /home/ubuntu/.chia,
# then start CADT with the command
#
# `systemctl start cadt@ubuntu`
#
